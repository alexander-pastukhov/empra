    Two superimposed semi-transparent orthogonally-oriented faces produce perceptual rivalry with one face being clearly perceived at a time and perception continuously switching between them. We investigated whether perceptual dominance of an individual face is determined by high-level properties, such as gender, age, or emotion, or low-level properties. To this end, we used twenty female and twenty male faces, aged 20 to 25, from the Chicago Face Database. They were randomly paired using a round-robin tournament schedule (eight blocks, twenty trials each). Participants viewed a face pair and continuously indicated which face they currently perceive via key presses. We computed two measures of face dominance, (i) as a proportion of trials in which it was the first face perceived at onset and (ii) as a proportion of time it was dominant throughout the trial. An exploratory data analysis using linear mixed models showed no systematic relationship between either of the two measures and high-level face descriptors, such as gender, age, or emotions (see https://osf.io/q2fjd). We conclude that in face rivalry perceptual dominance is determined primarily by low-level features such as the size or relative width of the face, or salient local features such as birthmarks.

    Multistable perception is typically studied using artificial stimuli, such as Necker cube. However, there are many photos posted online that are visually incongruent or produce bistable perception. We compiled a set of 103 unusual looking photos plus a complimentary set of 309 unambiguous but visually similar photos that can be used to study multistability using more naturalistic stimuli (https://osf.io/xezny). During each of the 103 trials, four photos (one target, three controls) were presented in four quadrants in random order, while observers’ gaze was monitored via an eye tracker. Observers were (i) asked to locate the target (unusual photo), (ii) to categorize the chosen photo as either bistable or visually incongruent, (iii) report their confidence, and (iv) report whether they had seen that photo before. Only few photos were categorized as purely bistable or visually incongruent. However, participants were very consistent in identifying the part of the image that had the visual conflict. Although odd photos were not visited sooner than control ones, once participants’ gaze landed on them, they were looked at for a significantly longer time than control photos. This indicates that visual conflict in naturalistic images is salient enough to retain attention and to command a prolonged inspection.

    Our perception reflects current sensory evidence but also the history of our previous perceptual decisions. This phenomenon is called serial dependence and is based on the assumption that the world around us is sufficiently stable and a recently made perceptual decision can be used as a supplementary source of information to reduce the uncertainty. In the case of the numerosity judgments, this means that responses for the same stimulus will be higher if it is a part of a descending sequence, as the preceding value is always larger biasing perception upwards, than for an ascending sequence. We tested this using a numerosity judgment task where participants had to estimate the numerosity of briefly presented dots either in full or divided attention conditions. We observed a strong serial dependence both in single and dual tasks. To quantify the effect of prior perception and attention, we used a modified Bayesian integration model that assumed (1) a non-monotonic relationship between numerosity and uncertainty, (2) a Gaussian distance measure between numerosity levels with a scale parameter controlling the relevance of prior decision for the current trial, i.e., smaller scale values mean that only nearby numerosity values are included into the decision, whereas large scale values mean lack of selectivity as any prior numerosity is included. We report that (1) overall uncertainty was the same for both attention conditions, (2) the weight of prior evidence was higher during poor attention blocks, (3) high selectivity (small values of scale parameter) during full attention but virtually no selectivity of prior evidence during poor attention. To summarize, consistent with the idea of attention as a filter, we found that although the prior perceptual decision was used with both full and poor attention, in the latter case it was used indiscriminately, irrespective of its relevance to the current judgment.

    When participants view stimuli compatible with multiple perceptual interpretations, their perception continuously switches. Multistable perception is often characterized by an average dominance phase duration, particularly, for studies that compare perception of different groups (patients versus healthy controls, old versus young adults, etc.). Here, we asked a question of how reliable this measure is and how variable it is across sessions compared to within session. We tested this by recruiting 31 participants over 3-5 days reporting on five bistable stimuli (2 versions of kinetic-depth effect that were identical in appearance but differed in rotation axis, Necker cube, moving plaid, and auditory streaming), three-minute blocks, twice per session in random order. The design means that for a given stimulus we can pick a pair of sessions, each two blocks long, and make a direct comparison for statistics of our choice within session (consistency of first and second block within each session A and B) versus between (consistency of first blocks between sessions A and B and same for second blocks). Using this approach, we compared block pairs within and between sessions based on average phase duration and state-dominance index using correlation, average phase differences, variance, and consistency in participant and stimuli order measures. First, we found no systematic changes over sessions. Second, we found that for most statistics variance between sessions was comparable to variance within session, so that reliability is not compromised by measuring over multiple days. Third, critically, variability of average dominance phase duration was so great even within session that it did not allow to reliably differentiate between participants or stimuli (within participant). Taken together, our results argue for caution when using average dominance phase duration as a measure of difference between participants.

    Multistable stimuli allow for several equally plausible perceptual interpretations, leading to spontaneous perceptual alternations despite constant sensory input. While often bistable, some visual displays can support three or four interpretations. In such cases, perceptual dominance may depend not only on the strength of a state but also on the plausibility of switching to it. We investigated this using a quadro-stable kinetic-depth effect—an ambiguously rotating cylinder with one half colored yellow and the other white. It could be seen as either a single rotating cylinder or two half-cylinders rotating in opposite directions (participants reported the rotation direction of the yellow half). In Experiment 1, participants viewed the stimulus continuously for three minutes. All four percepts were equally dominant at the group level. To analyze transition probabilities between perceptual states, we fitted four Bayesian models: (1) equal transitions, (2) symmetrical pair-based transitions, (3) symmetric plausibility but probability computed relative to other transitions, and (4) unique transition probabilities for each pair and direction. Model comparison using information criteria favored the third model, suggesting that while some transitions are more plausible, the actual transition depends on the set of available states and plausibility of transitions to them. In Experiment 2, we presented the stimulus intermittently with blank intervals of 50 ms, 0.5 s, or 1 s, known to evoke different aftereffects. For brief interruptions, the same percept usually resumed. For longer gaps, whole-cylinder percepts tended to persist, but half-cylinder percepts often re-emerged as whole-cylinder percepts with the same rotation direction. This suggests that after a 1 s break, visual memory retains motion direction but may not encode the specific configuration. In sum, truly multistable displays reveal how perceptual decisions depend not just on possible outcomes but also on the structure and plausibility of transitions between states.
